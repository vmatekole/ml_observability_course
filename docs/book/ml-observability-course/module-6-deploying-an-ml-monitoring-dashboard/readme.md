# Module 6: Deploying an ML monitoring dashboard [PRACTICE] 

As you deploy multiple models in production, you often want a live monitoring dashboard showing how all your ML models perform over time. The dashboard helps visualize the performance, detect issues, and debug them.

In this module, we will show an end-to-end example of designing and deploying an ML monitoring dashboard. We will cover both batch and near real-time model monitoring architectures. You will work with tools like Evidently and Grafana.

This is a code-focused module that includes hosting a local ML monitoring dashboard.
