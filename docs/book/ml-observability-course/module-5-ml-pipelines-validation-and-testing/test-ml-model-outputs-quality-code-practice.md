**Video 4**. [Test ML model outputs and quality [CODE PRACTICE]](https://youtu.be/AcVhZeQvjSo?si=X9sleg-hV6kjbfJz), by Emeli Dral

In this video, we test the quality of the model outputs after we generate the predictions. We also test the model quality after we get the new labeled data.

**Want to go straight to code?** Here is the [example notebook](https://github.com/evidentlyai/ml_observability_course/blob/main/module5/model_quality_practice.ipynb) to follow along.

**Outline:** \

[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcVhZeQvjSo&t=124s) Data loading and prep \
[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcVhZeQvjSo&t=370s) Load the model and get predictions \
[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcVhZeQvjSo&t=581s) Test model outputs and interpret the results \
[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcVhZeQvjSo&t=818s) Run tests for the next batch of data \
