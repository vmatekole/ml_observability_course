**Video 8**. [Log data drift test results to MLflow [CODE PRACTICE]](https://youtu.be/gluRb9TbWSE?si=2Bw77DLhy_AKS-gz), by Emeli Dral

In this video, we show how to log the results of data drift tests implemented with Evidently to Mlflow and view the results in the MLflow interface.

**Want to go straight to code?** Here is the [code example](https://github.com/evidentlyai/ml_observability_course/tree/main/module5/mlflow_logging) to follow along.

**Outline:** \

[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=50s) Start creating an MLflow script \
[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=108s) Set up the database and preview the MLflow UI \
[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=190s) Writing the Python script: overview and imports \
[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=264s) Writing the Python script: set experiments \
[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=483s) Writing the Python script: log parameters and reports \
[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=615s) Run the script and view the results \
[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gluRb9TbWSE&t=810s) Run a new experiment to log HTML reports \
