# Module 3: ML monitoring for unstructured data

This module covers evaluating and monitoring the production performance for models that use unstructured data, including LLM-based systems. 

We will cover:
* Why monitoring unstructured data is difficult;
* How to measure text data quality;
* What are text descriptors and how to use them;
* How to deal with embeddings;
* How to deal with multimodal data.

This module includes both a **theoretical part and code practice**. At the end of this module, you will understand the possible approaches to monitoring ML models that work with texts and other unstructured data.
